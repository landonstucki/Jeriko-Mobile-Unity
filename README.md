# Overview

This is a game that I have been wanting to create for a long time. In the past two weeks I challenged myself to get some animation, a small part of the world, and movement as well as camera movement integrated
as a challenge to better my skills in C# and the Unity Game Engine.

The game so far just has camera movement working and player movement. You can move with the 'W,A,S,D' keys, feel free to try and break it by throwing in combinations of movements (it should not break).
You can open and close the Inventory with 'E'.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
